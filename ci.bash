  #  1. Only one thread can use the yubikey at a time, so there shouldn't be any parallelism
  #  2. The yubikey is so slow. Like so slow. So everyone now and then run test with the yubikey
  #     but by-in-large, ok to use our mocked-out yubikey (which you get by default).
  #
  # Also, eventual CI won't have have a yubikey, so we need to be able to run tests without it.
